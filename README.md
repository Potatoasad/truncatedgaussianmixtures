Fit data to mixtures of *truncated* multivariate gaussians

```math
   p(x) = \sum_k w_k\  \phi_{[{\bf a}, {\bf b}]}({\bf x} | \boldsymbol{\mu}_k, \boldsymbol{\Sigma}_k)
```

where ${\bf a}$ and ${\bf b}$ are the bounding corners of the hypercube we would like to truncate the gaussian in.
This package supports

- Full, Diagonal and Block diagonal covariances for each component
- Inteface to allow one to perform the fit in some latent space given by a user-defined transformation, and carry along any target labels
- Sampling and pdf evaluation from the resultant fit


Quick Start
===============================================================
You can install this library using

```bash
pip install truncatedgaussianmixtures
```

You can then import truncatedgaussianmixtures. At the first import it may take a while, since this will create a local
julia installation. This will only happen once at the first ever import. 

The main function to use is `fit_gmm`. The following is a simple example use case. 

```python
   import pandas as pd
   from truncatedgaussianmixtures import fit_gmm

   # Generate some data
   df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(80_000, 2), columns=["x", "y"])
   
   # Truncated it to the unit square
   cond = (df['x'] < 1) & (df['x'] > 0)  
   cond &= (df['y'] < 1) & (df['y'] > 0)
   df = df[cond]

   # Fit it a truncated gaussian mixture model to it
   gmm = fit_gmm(data = df,      # data to fit to
                 N    = 1,       # Number of components of the mixture model
                 a    = [0,0],   # lower corner of the truncation
                 b    = [1,1],   # upper corner of the truncation
                 cov  = "diag"   # covariance structure: any of ("diag", "full")
          )

   # Sample from the gmm
   df_fit = gmm.sample(len(df));

   # Evaluate it at different points
   gmm.pdf(np.array([0,0]))
```
